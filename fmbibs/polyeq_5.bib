  SUMMARY = {In this article, the principal $n$-th root of 
  a complex number is defined, the Vieta's formulas for 
  polynomial equations of degree 2, 3 and 4 are formalized. 
  The solution of quadratic equations, the Cardan's solution 
  of cubic equations and the Descartes-Euler solution of 
  quartic equations in terms of their complex coefficients 
  are also presented \cite{Korn}.}}
