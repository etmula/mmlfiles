  SUMMARY = {In this article, the definitions and basic properties
  of Riemann-Stieltjes integral are formalized.
  In the first section, we showed the preliminary definition.
  We proved also some properties of finite sequences of real numbers.
  In Sec. 2, we defined variation. Using the definition, we also
  defined bounded variation and total variation, and proved theorems about
  related properties.
  In Sec. 3, we defined Riemann-Stieltjes integral. Referring to the
  way of the article \cite{INTEGR18.ABS}, we described the definitions.
  In the last section, we proved theorems about linearity of
  Riemann-Stieltjes integral. Because there are two types of linearity
  in Riemann-Stieltjes integral, we proved linearity in two ways.
  We showed the proof of theorems based on the description of
  the article \cite{INTEGR18.ABS}.
  These formalizations are based on \cite{Stroock1999},
  \cite{Kestelman1960}, \cite{Gupta1986}, and \cite{Hille1974}.}}
