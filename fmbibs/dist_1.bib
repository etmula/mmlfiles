  SUMMARY = {A pseudorandom number generator plays an important 
  role in practice in computer science. For example: computer 
  simulations, cryptology, and so on. A pseudorandom number generator 
  is an algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers that is 
  indistinguishable from the true random number sequence. 
  In this article, we shall formalize the ``Uniform Distribution" 
  that is the idealized set of true random number sequences. 
  The basic idea of our formalization is due to \cite{CINTA}.}}
