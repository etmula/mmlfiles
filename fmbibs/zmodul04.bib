  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize a free $\mathbb Z$-module and
  its property.  Specially, we formalize a vector space of rational field
  corresponding to a free $\mathbb Z$-module and prove formally that
  submodules of a free $\mathbb Z$-module are free.
  $\mathbb Z$-module is necassary for lattice problems,
  LLL(Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov\'asz) base reduction algorithm
  and cryptographic systems with lattice \cite{LAT}.
  Some theorems in this article are described by translating
  theorems in \cite{RLVECT_5.ABS} into theorems of
  Z-module, however their proofs are different.},
