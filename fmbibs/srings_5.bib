    SUMMARY = {In \cite{MFOLD_2.ABS}, Marco Riccardi formalized
    that $\mathbb{R}$N-basis $n$ is a basis (in the algebraic sense
    defined in \cite{RLVECT_3.ABS}) of $\cal E^n_T$ and
    in \cite{MFOLD_1.ABS} he has formalized that $\cal E^n_T$ is
    second-countable, we build (in the topological sense defined in \cite{CANTOR_1.ABS}) a denumerable base of $\cal E^n_T$.
    \par
  Then we introduce the $n$-dimensional intervals (interval in $n$-dimensional
  Euclidean space, \textit{pav`e (born de $\mathbb{R}^n$} \cite{mawhin1992analyse},
  \textit{semi-intervalle} (born de $\mathbb{R}^n$\cite{SchmetsAM:2004}).
   \par
  We conclude with the definition of Chebyshev distance
