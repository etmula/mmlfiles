  SUMMARY = {We formalize in the Mizar System \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, 
   basic definitions of commutative ring theory such as prime spectrum, 
   nilradical, Jacobson radical and local ring, and semi-local ring, then 
   formalize proofs of some relating theorems along with the first chapter 
   of \cite{AM}. \par
   We denote $\mathrm{Spec} \ A$ for the set of all prime ideals of a 
   commutative ring $A$ and introduce the so-called Zariski topology 
   in order to make $\mathrm{Spec} \ A$ a topological space. We formalize 
   a topological space defined by the topology and provide a formal proof 
   of the fact that $\mathrm{Spec} \ A$ is $\mathrm{T_0}$ space.  
   Finally we formalize a continuous map associated with a ring 
   homomorphism $h:A \longrightarrow B$.  Namely, $h$ induces a continuous 
   map ${}^{a}h:\mathrm{Spec} \ B \longrightarrow \mathrm{Spec} \ A$ (${}^{a}h$ 
   which is defined by ${}^{a}h(\mathfrak{P}) = h^{-1}(\mathfrak{P}),$ 
    where $\mathfrak{P}$ is a prime ideal of $B$.},
