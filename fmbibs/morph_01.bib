  SUMMARY = {In this article we defined mathematical
  morphology image processing with set operations.
  First, we defined Minkowski set operations and proved their properties.
  Next we defined basic image processing, dilation and erosion proving
  basic fact about them \cite{Heijmans:1994}, \cite{Soille:2003}.},
