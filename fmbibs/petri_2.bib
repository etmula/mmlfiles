  SUMMARY = {Based on the Petri net definitions and theorems already formalized 
  in  \cite{PETRI.ABS}, with this article, we developed the concept of 
  ``Cell Petri Nets". It is based on \cite{Kawamoto-Nakamura:1996}. 
  In a cell Petri net we introduce the notions of colors and colored 
  states of a Petri net, connecting mappings for linking two Petri 
  nets, firing rules for transitions, and the synthesis of two or 
  more Petri nets.}}
