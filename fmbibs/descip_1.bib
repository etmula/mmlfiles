  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize DES,
   the Data Encryption Standard, that was the most
  widely used symmetric cryptosystem in the world.
  DES is a block cipher which was selected by
  the National Bureau of Standards as an official
   Federal Information Processing Standard for the
   United States in 1976 \cite{FIPS}.},
