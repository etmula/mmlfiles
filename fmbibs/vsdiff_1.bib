  SUMMARY = {In \cite{DIFF_1.ABS}, the definitions of forward difference,
    backward difference, and central difference were formalized.
    Those definitions are formalized as difference of a function from
    $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$. In this article, we formalize the
    definitions of forward difference, backward difference, and central
    difference of a function on a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$.
    In cryptology, these definitions are very important in evaluating
    the security of cryptographic systems \cite{Lai1994}. Moreover, we
    formalize some facts about these definitions.},
  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT = {We sincerely thank Professor Yasunari Shidama
    for his helpful advices.}}
