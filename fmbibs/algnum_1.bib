  SUMMARY = {This article provides definitions and examples upon an integral element of
  unital commutative rings. An algebraic number is also treated as consequence of a concept of
  "integral". Definitions for an integral closure, an algebraic integer and
  a transcendental numbers are included as well \cite{ZariskiSamuel:1975},
  \cite{AtiyaMacDonald:1969}.
  As an application of an algebraic number, this article includes a formal proof of
  a ring extension of rational number field $\mathbb{Q}$ induced by substitution
  of an algebraic number to the polynomial ring of $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ turns to be a field.}}
