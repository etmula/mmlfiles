      SUMMARY = {In this article we further extend the algebraic theory of polynomial
                 rings in Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015,FourDecades,AlgHierarchy}:
                 We deal with roots and multiple roots of polynomials and show that
                 both the real numbers and finite domains are not algebraically closed.
                 We also prove the identity theorem for polynomials and that the
                 number of multiple roots is bounded by the polynomial's degree \cite{HH90}.}}
