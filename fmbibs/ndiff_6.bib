  SUMMARY = {In this article, authors formalized the Fr\acute{e}chet differentiation.
  It is defined as a generalization of the differentiation
  of a real-valued function of a single real variable
  to more general functions whose domain and range are
  subsets of normed spaces \cite{Schwartz:1981}.},
