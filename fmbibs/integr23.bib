  SUMMARY = {In this article, The basic existence theorem of Riemann-Stieltjes Integral is formalized.
  This theorem describes if $f$ is a continuous function and $\rho$ is a function of bounded variation
  in a closed interval of real line, $f$ is Riemann-Stieltjes Integrable with respect to $\rho$.
  In the first section, basic properties of real finite sequences are formalized as preliminaries.
  In the second section, we formalized the existence theorem of Riemann-Stieltjes integral.
  These formalizations are based on \cite{Stroock1999}, \cite{Kestelman1960}, \cite{Gupta1986}, and \cite{Hille1974}.}}
