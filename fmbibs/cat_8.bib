  SUMMARY = {In the first part of this article we formalize the concepts of terminal and initial
  object, categorical product \cite{Borceaux} and natural transformation within a free-object
  category \cite{Adamek:2009}. In particular, we show that this definition of natural transformation
  is equivalent to the standard definition \cite{MacLane:1}. Then we introduce the exponential
  object using its universal property and we show the isomorphism between the exponential object
  of categories and the functor category\cite{Lawvere:1963}.}}
