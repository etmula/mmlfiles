  SUMMARY = {A complex polynomial is called a Hurwitz polynomial, if all its roots have a
              real part smaller than zero. This kind of polynomial plays an all-dominant role
              in stability checks of electrical (analog or digital) networks.\\
              In this article we prove that a polynomial $p$ can be shown to be Hurwitz
              by checking whether the rational function $e(p)/o(p)$ can be realized as a
              reactance one port, that is as an electrical impedance or admittance consisting
              of inductors and capacitors. Here $e(p)$ and $o(p)$ denote the even and the odd part
              of $p$ \cite{Unb93}.}}
