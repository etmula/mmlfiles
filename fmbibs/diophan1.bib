  SUMMARY = {This article provides a formalized proof of known
  results of approximation of an irrational by rational numbers.
  A typical example of Diophantine approximation is to find integer
  solution $(x,y)$ of the inequality $| x\theta - y | \leq  1/x$
  where $\theta$ is a real. Firstly we provide necessary results from
  continued fractions. Secondary we prove the inequality has infinitely
  many solution by a continued fraction. Finally provided Dirichlet's
  proof (1842) of existence of the solution \cite{HardyWright:2008},
  \cite{Baker:1984}.}}
