  SUMMARY = {This article is the third in a series formalizing some results
  in my joint work with Prof.\ Joanna Goli\'nska-Pilarek
  (\cite{GPH:2012} and more recent research) concerning a logic proposed by
  Prof. Andrzej Grzegorczyk (\cite{Grzegorczyk:2012}).\\
  This part presents the syntax and axioms of Grzegorczyk's
  {\em Logic of Descriptions} (LD) as originally proposed by him,
  as well as some theorems not depending on any semantic constructions.}}
