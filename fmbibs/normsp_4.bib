  SUMMARY = {In this article, the separability of real normed
  spaces and its properties are mainly formalized.
  In the first section, it is proved that a real normed subspace
  is separable
  if it is generated by a countable subset. We used here the fact that the
  rational numbers form a dense subset of the real numbers.
  In the second section, the basic properties of the separable normed spaces
  are discussed. It is applied to isomorphic spaces via bounded
  linear operators and double dual spaces.
  In the last section, it is proved that the completeness and
  reflexivity are transferred to sublinear normed spaces.
  The formalization is based on \cite{yoshida:1980},
  and also referred to \cite{BOURBAKI:1-5}, \cite{Dunford:1958}
  and \cite{kolmogorov2012}.},
