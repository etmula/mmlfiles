  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize the definition of "torsion-part"
  of $\mathbb Z$-module and its properties.
  We show $\mathbb Z$-module generated by the field of rational numbers
  as an example of torsion-free non free $\mathbb Z$-modules.
  We also formalize the rank-nullity theorem over finite-rank free
  $\mathbb Z$-modules.
  $\mathbb Z$-module is necessary for lattice problems,
  LLL (Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov\'asz) base reduction algorithm
  and cryptographic systems with lattices \cite{LAT}.}}
