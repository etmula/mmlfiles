  SUMMARY = {This paper is a continuation of \cite{NUMERAL1.ABS},
  where the divisibility criteria for initial prime numbers
  based on their representation in the decimal system
  were formalized. In the current paper we consider
  all primes up to 101 to demonstrate the
  method presented in \cite{Briggs2000}.}}
