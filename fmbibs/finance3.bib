  SUMMARY = {First we give an implementation in Mizar \cite{Mizar:2015}
  of basic important definitions of stochastic finance, i.e. filtration
             (\cite{klenke}, p. 183, 185), (adapted) stochastic process
             (\cite{klenke}, p. 185) and predictable stochastic process
             (\cite{follmerschied:2004}, p. 224). Second we give some
             concrete formalization and verification to real world examples.
             \par
             In article \cite{FINANCE2.ABS}
             we started to define random variables for a
             similar presentation to the book \cite{follmerschied:2004}. Here
             we continue to do this. Next we define the stochastic process.
             For further definitions based on stochastic process we implement
             the definition of filtration.
             \par
             To get a better understanding we give a real world example and
             connect the statements to the theorems.
             Other similar examples are given in \cite{kremer:2006},
              p. 143--159
             and \cite{sandmann:2001}, p. 110--124.
             \par
             First we introduce sets which give informations depending on
             today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.
              \par
             Today: Omega_now = {{},{1,2,3,4}}
                    see FINANCE3:def 6, Special_SigmaField1
             Tomorrow: Omega_fut1 = {{},{1,2},{3,4},{1,2,3,4}}
                    see FINANCE3:def 7, Special_SigmaField2
             The day after tomorrow: Omega_fut2 =
                       power set of({1,2,3,4})
                    see FINANCE3:def 8, Special_SigmaField3
             \par
             We give an overview for some events in the sigma-algebras
             Omega_now,Omega_fut1,Omega_fut2:
             \par
             Events of Omega_fut2  Events of Omega_fut1   Events of Omega_now
                  {}              =         {}          =         {}
                 {1}             c=        {1,2}       c=   {1,2,3,4}
                 {2}             c=        {1,2}       c=   {1,2,3,4}
                 {3}             c=        {3,4}       c=   {1,2,3,4}
                 {4}             c=        {3,4}       c=   {1,2,3,4}
              {1,2,3,4}           =      {1,2,3,4}      =   {1,2,3,4}
                  see FINANCE3:20 and FINANCE3:21
             The given events are necessary for creating our next functions.
              \par
             The implementations looks like:
             Omega_now c= Omega_fut1 c= Omega_fut2 see theorem FINANCE3:22.
             This tells us growing informations from now to the future
             1=now, 2=tomorrow, 3=the day after tomorrow.
             We install functions f:{1,2,3,4} -> R as following:
             f_1:x->100 for all x in dom f
                   see theorem FINANCE3:38
             f_2:x-> 80 for x=1 or x=2 and
             f_2:->120 for x=3 or x=4
                   see theorem FINANCE3:39
             f_3:x->60 if x=1,f_3:x->80 if x=2,
             f_3:x->100 if x=3,f_3:x->120 if x=4
                   see FINANCE3:40
             These functions are real random variables - f_1 over Omega_now,
             f_2 over Omega_fut1 and f_3 over Omega_fut2 -.
                   see FINANCE3:48, FINANCE3:45, FINANCE3:42
             We can prove that these functions can be used for giving an example
             for an adapted stochastic process. See FINANCE3:51.
             We want to give an interpretation to these functions:
             Suppose you have an equity A which has now (=w1) the value 100.
             Tomorrow A changes depending which scenario occurs e.g. another
             marketing strategy -.  In Scenario 1 (=w11) it has the value 80 in
             scenario 2 (=w12) it has the value 120. The day after to tomorrow
             A changes again. In scenario 1 (=w111) it has the value 60, in
             scenario 2 (w=112) the value 80, in scenario 3 (=w121) the value
             100 and in scenario 4 (=w122) it has the value 120.
             For a visualization look at the following tree:
              \par
                    Now         tomorrow    The day after tomorrow
                                         / -  w111={1}
                                w11={1,2}
                             /           \ -  w112={2}
                 w1={1,2,3,4}
                              \          / -  w121={3}
                                w12={3,4}
                                         \ -  w122={4}
             The sets w1,w11,w12,w111,w112,w121,w122 which are subsets of
             {1,2,3,4} tell us which market scenario occurs.
             \par
             The functions tell us the values to the relevant market scenario:
                   Now         tomorrow    The day after tomorrow
                                              f_3(wi)= 60,
                               f_2(wi)=80,    wi in w111
                               wi in w11      f_3(w112)= 80,
                f_1(wi)=100,                  wi in w112
                wi in w1                      f_3(w121)= 100,
                               f_2(wi)=120,   wi in w121
                               wi in w12      f_3(w122)=120,
                                              wi in w122
             For a better understanding of the definition of the
             random-variable and the relation to the functions look at
             \cite{georgii:2004}, p. 20. For the proof of certain sets as
             $\sigma$-fields look at \cite{georgii:2004}, p. 10--11
             and \cite{klenke:2006}, p. 1--2.
             \par
             This article is the next step to the arbitrage opportunity.
             If you use for example a simple probability measure, look e.g.
             to the literature \cite{caratheodorycommunity:2004}, p. 28--34,
             \cite{follmerschied:2004}, p. 6 and p. 232 you can calculate whether
             an arbitrage exists or not.
             Note, that the example given in the literature
             \cite{caratheodorycommunity:2004} need 8 instead of 4 informations
             as in our model. If we want to code the first 3 given time points
             into our model we would have the following graph (see FINANCE3:49,
             FINANCE3:46, FINANCE3:43)
             \par
                   Now         tomorrow    The day after tomorrow
                                              f_3(wi)= 180,
                               f_2(wi)=150,    wi in w111
                               wi in w11      f_3(w112)= 120,
                f_1(wi)=125,                  wi in w112
                wi in w1                      f_3(w121)= 120,
                               f_2(wi)=100,   wi in w121
                               wi in w12      f_3(w122)=80,
                                              wi in w122
             The Function for the Call-Option is given in the literature
             \cite{caratheodorycommunity:2004}, p. 29. The function is realized
             in definition FINANCE3:def 5.
              \par
             As a background, more examples for using the definition of
             filtration are given in \cite{klenke:2006}, p. 185--188.}}
