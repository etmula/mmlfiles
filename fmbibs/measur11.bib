  SUMMARY = {The purpose of this article is to show Fubini's theorem on measure \cite{Halmos74},
  \cite{Bauer:2002}, \cite{Bogachev2007measure}, \cite{FOLLAND},
  \cite{Rao2004}. Some theorems have
  possibility slight generalization, but we have priority to avoid the complexity of description.
  First of all, for the product measure constructed in \cite{MEASUR10.abs}, we show some theorems.
  Then we introduce the section which play an important role in Fubini's theorem, and prove the
  relevant proposition. Finally we show Fubini's theorem on measure.}}
