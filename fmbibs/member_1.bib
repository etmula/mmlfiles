  SUMMARY = {The article starts with definitions of sets of opposite and 
  inverse numbers of a given number membered set. Next, collective addition,   subtraction, multiplication and division of two sets are defined. 
  Complex numbers cases and extended real numbers ones are introduced 
  separately and unified for reals. Shortcuts for singletons cases are also defined.}}
