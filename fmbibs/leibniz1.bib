  SUMMARY = {In this article we prove the Leibniz's Series for Pi
  which states that $$\frac{\pi}{4}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2\cdot n+1}.$$
  \par The formalization follows K. Knopp \cite{Knopp}.
  {L}eibniz's {S}eries for {P}i is listed as \#26 at Freek Wiedijk's
   list of ``Top 100 mathematical theorems" \cite{Freek-100-theorems}.}}
