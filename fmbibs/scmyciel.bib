  SUMMARY = {Harary~\cite[p.~7]{Harary69} claims
  that Veblen~\cite[p.~2]{Veblen31}
  first suggested to formalize simple graphs using simplicial complexes.
  We have developed basic terminology for simple graphs as
  as at most 1-dimensional complexes.\par
  We formalize this new setting and then reprove Mycielski's~\cite{Mycielski55}
  construction resulting in a triangle-free graph with
  arbitrarily large chromatic number. A different formalization
  of similar material is in~\cite{MYCIELSK.ABS}.}}
