  SUMMARY = {This text includes definition and basic notions of
    product of posets, flat posets, flattening operation,
    and existence theorems of recursive call using flattening
    operator. Part of the article, devoted to product and flat posets
    has pure mathematical flavour, the other one builds the background
    for information-engineering approach for lists, namely recursive
    call for posets \cite{Winskel:1993}. We formalized some facts from
    Chapter 8 of this book opening the path for the next two sections
    but we concentrate on binary product of posets rather than on
    more general case.}}
