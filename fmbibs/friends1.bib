  SUMMARY = {In this article we prove the friendship theorem
  according to the article \cite{MAlbert},
  which states that if a group of people has the property that any
  pair of persons have exactly one common friend,
  then there is a universal friend,
  i.e. a person who is a friend of every other person in the group.}}
