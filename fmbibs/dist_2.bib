  SUMMARY = {In \cite{DIST_1.ABS}, we formalized probability and
  probability distribution on a finite sample space.
  In this article first we  propose a
  formalization of the class of finite
  sample spaces whose element's probability distributions
  are equivalent with each other. Next we formalize the
  probability measure of the class of sample spaces we have
  formalized above. Finally then, we formalize the sampling and
  posterior probability.}}
