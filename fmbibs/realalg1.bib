      SUMMARY = {We introduce ordered rings and fields
      following Artin-Schreier's approach using
      positive cones. We show that such orderings coincide with total order
      relations and give examples of ordered (and non ordered) rings and fields.
      In particular we show that polynomial rings can be ordered in (at least)
      two different ways \cite{Pre84,KS89,Jac64,Rad91}.}}
