  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we defined the reduced residue system and
    proved its fundamental properties. Then we proved the basic
    properties of the order function. Finally, we defined the primitive
    root and proved its fundamental properties. Our work is based on
    \cite{Hua1957}, \cite{Dexin1965}, and \cite{HardyWright}.}}
