 SUMMARY = {Binary representation of integers and arithmetic operations
  on them have already been introduced
  in MML \cite{BINARITH.ABS,BINARI_2.ABS,BINARI_3.ABS,BINARI_4.ABS}.
  However, these articles formalize the notion of integers as mapped
  into a certain length tuple of boolean values.
  In this article, we formalize the binary representation of natural
  numbers which maps ${\mathbb N}$ into bitstreams.},
