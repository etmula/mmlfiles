  SUMMARY = {In the previous article \cite{GLIB_006.ABS} supergraphs and several specializations
  to formalize the process of drawing graphs were introduced. In this paper another
  such operation is formalized: Drawing a vertex and then immediately drawing edges
  connecting this vertex with a subset of the other vertices of the graph. In case the
  new vertex is joined with all vertices of a given graph $G$, this is known as the
  join of $G$ and the trivial loopless graph $K_1$. While the join of two graphs is
  known and found in standard literature (like \cite{SIMPLE}, \cite{MULTI}
  and \cite{SELECTED}), the operation discribed in this article is not.\par
  Alongside the new operation a mode to reverse the directions of a subset of
  the edges of a graph is introduced. When all edge directions of a graph are
  reversed, this is commonly known as the converse of a (directed) graph.
