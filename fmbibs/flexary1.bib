  SUMMARY = {In this article we introduce necessary notation
  and definitions to prove the Euler's Partition Theorem
  according to H.S. Wilf's lecture notes \cite{HSWift}.
  Our aim is to create an environment which
  allows to formalize the theorem in a way that is as similar as possible
  to the original informal proof. \par

             list of ``Top 100 mathematical
             theorems" \cite{Freek-100-theorems}.}}
