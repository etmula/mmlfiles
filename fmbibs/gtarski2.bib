  SUMMARY = {In our earlier Mizar article \cite{GTARSKI1.ABS},
    the first part of axioms of geometry due to Alfred Tarski
    \cite{TarskiGivant}, was formally introduced.
    We defined a structure \verb!TarskiPlane! with the following predicates:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item of betweenness \verb!between! (a ternary relation),
    \item of \verb!equiv! (quarternary relation),
    \item of congruence \verb!cong! (relation with 6 arguments),
    \end{itemize}
    \noindent
    which satisfy the following properties:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item congruence symmetry (A1),
    \item congruence equivalence relation (A2),
    \item congruence identity (A3),
    \item segment construction (A4),
    \item SAS (A5),
    \item betweenness identity (A6),
    \item Pasch (A7).
    \end{itemize}
    Also a simple model, which satisfies these axioms,
    was previosly constructed. In this paper, we deal with four
    remaining axioms, namely:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the lower dimension axiom (A8),
    \item the upper dimension axiom (A9),
    \item the Euclid axiom (A10),
    \item the continuity axiom (A11).
    \end{itemize}
    They were introduced in the form of Mizar attributes.
    \par
    In order to show that the structure which satisfies all eleven
    Tarski's axioms really exists, we provided a proof of the registration
    of a cluster that the Euclidean plane, or rather
    a natural extension of ordinary metric structure \verb!Euclid 2!
    satisfies all these attributes.
    \par
    Connection with Isabelle should be mentioned -- we had some doubts about
    the proof of the Euclid's axiom and inspection of the proof taken from
    Archive of Formal Proofs clarified things a bit.}}
