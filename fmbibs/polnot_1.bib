  SUMMARY = {This article is the first in a series formalizing some results
  in my joint work with Prof.\ Joanna Goli\'nska-Pilarek
  (\cite{GPH:2012} and more recent research) concerning a logic proposed by
  Prof. Andrzej Grzegorczyk (\cite{Grzegorczyk:2012}).\\
  We present some mathematical folklore about representing formulas
  in Polish notation, that is, with operators of fixed arity prepended to
  their arguments. This notation eliminates the need for parentheses.}}
