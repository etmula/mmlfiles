  SUMMARY = {The article continues the formalization
    of the lattice theory (as structures with two binary operations,
    not in terms of ordering relations).
  In the paper, the notion of a pseudocomplement in a lattice is
  formally introduced in Mizar, and based on this we define the notion
  of the skeleton and the set of dense elements in a pseudo-complemented
  lattice, giving the meet-decomposition of arbitrary element of a lattice
  as the infimum of two elements: one belonging to the skeleton, and
  the other which is dense.
  \par
  The core of the paper is of course the idea of Stone identity
  $$a^{\star} \sqcup a^{\star\star} = \top,$$
  which is fundamental for us: Stone lattices are those lattices $L$,
  which are distributive, bounded, and satisfy Stone identity for all
  elements $a\in L.$
  Stone algebras were introduced by Gr\"atzer and Schmidt
  in \cite{Gratzer:1957}.
  \par
  All Boolean lattices are Stone, and
  a natural example of the lattice which is Stone, but not Boolean,
  is the lattice of all natural divisors of $p^2$ for arbitrary
  prime number $p$. At the end we formalize the notion of
  the Stone lattice constructed as a sublattice of $B^2$, where $B$
  is arbitrary Boolean algebra (and we describe skeleton and
  the set of dense elements in such lattices).
  In a natural way, we deal
  with Cartesian product of pseudo-complemented lattices.
  \par
  Our formalization was inspired by \cite{NewGratzer}, and is an important
  step in formalizing Jouni J{\"a}rvinen \emph{Lattice theory
  for rough sets} \cite{Jarvinen:2007}, so it follows rather the
  latter paper.}}
