  SUMMARY = {In the article we present in the Mizar system
  \cite{Mizar-State-2015} the catalogue of triangular norms and conorms,
  used especially in the theory of fuzzy sets \cite{Zadeh:1965}. The name
  \emph{triangular} emphasizes the fact that in the framework of
  probabilistic metric spaces they generalize triangle inequality.\par
  We introduced the following t-norms:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item minimum t-norm \verb!minnorm!,
  \item product t-norm \verb!prodnorm!,
  \item \L ukasiewicz t-norm \verb!Lukasiewicz_norm!,
  \item drastic t-norm \verb!drastic_norm!,
  \item nilpotent minimum \verb!nilmin_norm!,
  \item Hamacher product \verb!Hamacher_norm!,
  \end{itemize}
  and corresponding t-conorms:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item maximum t-conorm \verb!maxnorm!,
  \item probabilistic sum \verb!probsum_conorm!,
  \item bounded sum \verb!BoundedSum_conorm!,
  \item drastic t-conorm \verb!drastic_conorm!,
  \item nilpotent maximum \verb!nilmax_conorm!,
  \item Hamacher t-conorm \verb!Hamacher_conorm!.
  \end{itemize}
  Their basic properties and duality are shown; we also
  proved the predicate of the ordering of norms \cite{Klement:2000},
  \cite{Hajek:1998}. This work is a continuation of the development
  of fuzzy sets in Mizar \cite{GrabowskiFuzzy:2013};
  it could be used to give a variety of
  more general operations on fuzzy sets.},}
