  SUMMARY = {We formalize that the image of a semiring of sets
  \cite{goguadze2003notion}
  by a injective function is a semiring of sets.
  We offer a non-trivial example of semiring of sets in a topological
  space \cite{Schmets:2004}.
  Finally, we show that the finite product of semiring of sets is a semiring
  of sets \cite{Schmets:2004} and
  that the finite product of classical semiring of sets
  \cite{bogachev2007measure}
  is a classical semiring of sets.
  In this case, we use here the notation of the book of Aliprantis and
  Border \cite{aliprantis2006infinite}.}}
