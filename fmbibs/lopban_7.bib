  SUMMARY = {In this article we formalize one of the most important
             theorems of linear operator theory -- the Closed Graph Theorem
             commonly used in a standard text book such as
             \cite{miyadera:1972} in Chapter 24.3.
             It states that a surjective closed linear operator between
             Banach spaces is bounded.}}
