  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize the definition of
  dual lattice and their properties.
  We formally prove that a set of all dual vectors in a rational lattice
  has the construction of a lattice.  
  We show that a dual basis can be calculated by elements of an inverse 
  of the Gram Matrix.
  We also formalize a summation of inner products and its properties.
  Lattice of $\mathbb Z$-module is necessary for lattice problems,

  and cryptographic systems with lattice \cite{LAT}.},
