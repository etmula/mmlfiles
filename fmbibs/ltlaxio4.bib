  SUMMARY = {We prove weak (finite set of premises) completeness
  theorem for extended propositional linear time temporal logic
  with irreflexive version of until-operator. We base on
  the proof for basic propositional linear time temporal
  logic given in \cite{KroMer} which roughly follows the
  idea of Henkin-Hasenjaeger method for classical logic.
  We show that a temporal model exists for every formula which
  negation is not derivable (Satisfiability Theorem).
  The contrapositive of that theorem leads to derivability
  of every valid formula. We build a tree of consistent and
  complete~PNPs  which is used to construct the model.}}
