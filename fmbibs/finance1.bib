  SUMMARY = {This article gives an elementary introduction
  to stochastic finance (in discrete time).
  A formalization of random variables is given
  and some elements of Borel sets
  are considered. Furthermore, special functions
  (for buying a present portfolio and the
  value of a portfolio in the future)
  and some statements about the relation between
  these functions are introduced (\cite{klenke:2006}
  (p. 185), \cite{georgii:2004}
  (p. 12, 20), \cite{follmerschied:2004} (p. 3--6)}).}
