  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize the definition of lattice of
  $\mathbb Z$-module and its properties in the Mizar system \cite{Mizar:2015}.
  We formally prove that scalar products in lattices are bilinear forms
  over the field of real numbers $\mathbb R$.
  We also formalize the definitions of positive definite and integral
  lattices and their properties.
  Lattice of $\mathbb Z$-module is necessary for lattice problems,
  LLL (Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov\'asz) base reduction algorithm \cite{LLL:1982},
  and cryptographic systems with lattices \cite{Micciancio:2002}
  and coding theory \cite{Ebeling:2013}.}}
