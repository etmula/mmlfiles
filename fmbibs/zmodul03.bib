  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize a free $\mathbb Z$-module
  and its rank.
  We formally prove that for a free finite-rank $\mathbb Z$-module $V$,
  the number of elements in its basis, that is a rank of
  the $\mathbb Z$-module, is constant regardless of selection of its basis.
  $\mathbb Z$-module is necessary for lattice problems,
  LLL(Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov\'asz) base reduction algorithm
  and cryptographic systems with lattice \cite{LAT}.
  Some theorems in this article are described by translating
  theorems in \cite{RLVECT_3.ABS} and \cite{RLVECT_5.ABS} into theorems of
  $\mathbb Z$-module.},
