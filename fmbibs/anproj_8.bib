    SUMMARY = {The real projective plane has been formalized in Isabelle/HOL
  by Timothy Makarios \cite{makarios2012mechanical} and
  in Coq by Nicols Magaud, Julien Narboux and
  Pascal Schreck \cite{magaud2008formalizing}. \par
  Some definitions on the real projective spaces were
  introduced early in the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML)
  by Wojciech Leonczuk and
  Krzysztof Prazmowski \cite{ANPROJ_1.ABS,ANPROJ_2.ABS} and
  by Wojciech Skaba \cite{COLLSP.ABS}.
  \par
  In this article, we check with the Mizar system \cite{Mizar-State-2015},
  some properties on the determinants and
  the Grassman-Pl\{ucker relation in rank 3
  \cite{apel2010cancellation,apel2014geometry,fuchs2010formalization,
       richter1995mechanical,richter2011perspectives}.
  \par
  Then we show that the projective space induced
  (in the sense defined in \cite{ANPROJ_1.ABS})
  by $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a projective plane
  (in the sense defined in \cite{ANPROJ_2.ABS}).
  \par
  Finally, in the real projective plane, we define the homography
  induced by a 3-by-3 invertible matrix and we show that
  the images of 3 collinear points are themselves collinear.},
