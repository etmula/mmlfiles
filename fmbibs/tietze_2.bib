  SUMMARY = {In this article we prove the Tietze extension theorem for an
             arbitrary convex compact subset of ${\cal E}^n$ with a non-empty
	     interior. This theorem states that, if $T$ is a normal topological
             space, $X$ is a closed subset of $T$, and $A$ is a convex compact
             subset of ${\cal E}^n$ with a non-empty interior, then a
             continuous function $f:X \rightarrow A$ can be extended to a
             continuous function $g:T\rightarrow {\cal E}^n$. Additionally we
             show that a subset $A$ is replaceable by an arbitrary subset of a
             topological space that is homeomorphic with a convex compact
             subset of ${\cal E}^n$ with a non-empty interior. This article
             is based on \cite{DUDA:BM61}; \cite{Engelking:1989},
             \cite{Engelking:1978} can also serve as reference books.}}
