  SUMMARY = {In this article, the equivalent expressions of the direct sum
   decomposition of groups are mainly discussed.
   In the first section, we formalize the fact that the internal direct sum
   decomposition can be defined as normal subgroups and some of their properties.
   In the second section, we formalize an equivalent form of internal direct sum
   of of commutative groups.
   In the last section, we formalize that the external direct sum leads
   an internal direct sum.
   We referred to \cite{rotman1995introduction}, \cite{robinson2012course}
   \cite{BourbakiAlgI} and \cite{lang-algebra} in the formalization.},
