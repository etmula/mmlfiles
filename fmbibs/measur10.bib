  SUMMARY = {In this article we formalize in Mizar \cite{Mizar:2015}
  product pre-measure on product sets of measurable sets.
  Although there are some approaches to construct product measure
  \cite{Halmos74}, \cite{Bauer:2002}, \cite{Bogachev2007measure}, \cite{FOLLAND},
  \cite{Rao:2004}, we start it from $\sigma$-measure
  because existence of $\sigma$-measure on any semialgebras has
  been proved in \cite{MEASURE9.ABS}.
  In this approach, we use some theorems for integrals.}}
