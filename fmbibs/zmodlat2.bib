  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize the definition of
  embedding of lattice and its properties.
  We formally define an inner product on an embedded module.
  We also formalize properties of Gram matrix.
  We formally prove that an inverse of Gram matrix for a rational lattice
  exists.
  Lattice of $\mathbb Z$-module is necessary for lattice problems,

  and cryptographic systems with lattice \cite{LAT}.},
