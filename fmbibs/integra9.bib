  SUMMARY = {In this article, we give several integrability formulas 
  of some functions including the trigonometric function and 
  the index function \cite{Chen:1978}. We also give the definitions 
  of the orthogonal polynomial and norm function, and some of 
  their important properties \cite{Renhong:1999}.}}
