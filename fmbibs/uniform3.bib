    SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize the notion of uniform
    space introduced by Andr\ç¿« Weil using the concepts of
    entourages \cite{bourbaki2013general}.
     \par
    We present some results between uniform space and pseudo-metric space.
     We introduce the concepts of left-uniformity and right-uniformity
     of a topological group.
    \par
    Next, we define the concept of the partition topology.
    \par
   Following the Vlach's work \cite{vlach2008topologies,vlach2008algebraic},
   we define the semi-uniform space induced by a tolerance
   and the uniform space induced by an equivalence relation.
     \par
   Finally, using mostly Gehrke, Mai and Grigorieff, Serge and
   Pin, Jean-{\'E}ric \cite{gehrke2010topological} work's,
   a Pervin uniform space defined from the sets of
   the form $((X\setminus A) \times (X\setminus A)) \cup (A\times A)$
   is presented.},
