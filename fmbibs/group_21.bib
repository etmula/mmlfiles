  SUMMARY = {In this article, conservation rules of the direct
    sum decomposition of groups are mainly discussed.
    In the first section, we prepare miscellaneous definitions and theorems
    for further formalization in Mizar \cite{Mizar:2015}.
    In the next three sections, we formalized the fact that
    the property of direct
    sum decomposition is preserved against the subsitutions of the subscript set,
    flattening of direct sum, and layering of direct sum, respectively.
    We referred to \cite{rotman1995introduction}, \cite{robinson2012course}
    \cite{BourbakiAlgI} and \cite{lang-algebra} in the formalization.}}
