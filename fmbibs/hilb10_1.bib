  SUMMARY = {In this article, we prove, using the Mizar formalism,
  a number of properties that correspond to the Pell's Equation
  to prove finally two basic lemmas that are essential in the proof
  of Matiyasevich's negative solution of Hilbert's tenth problem.
  \par For this purpose, first, we focus on a special case of the
  Pell's Equation, which has the form
  \begin{equation}x^2-(a^2-1)y^2=1,
  \end{equation} where $a>1$ and integer numerical solutions
  are sought for $x$ and $y$. We develop the Pell's Equation
  theory formalized for the general case in \cite{Pelle_eq.abs}.
  Note that $x_0(a)=1$, $y_0(a)=0$ is an obvious solution.
  Additionally, if we know a solution of the Pell's equation,
  we can determine all solutions as well as we can order them.
  In our case the $n+1$-solution $x_{n+1}(a)$, $y_{n+1}(a)$
  can be simply determined in terms of the $n$-solution as follows:
  \begin{align}
   x_{n+1}(a) =& a \cdot x_n(a) + (a^2-1)\cdot y_n(a)\notag\\
   y_{n+1}(a) =&  x_n(a) + a \cdot y_n(a)\notag
  \end{align}
  We show a number of dependency between the elements of these sequences
  to provide that the equality $y_z(a)=y$ is diophantin.
  For this purpose we justify that for a given $a$, $z$, $y$ holds
  $y_z(a)=y$ if and only if the following system has a solution for
  natural numbers $x$, $x_1$, $y_1$, $A$, $x_2$, $y_2$:
  \begin{align}
    &a>1 \;\wedge\; y_1\geq y \;\wedge\; A > y \;\wedge\; y \geq z\;\wedge\notag\\
    &x^2 - (a^2-1)y^2 =1\;\wedge\; x_1^2 - (a^2-1)y_1^2 =1\;\wedge\; x_2^2 - (A^2-1)y_2^2 =1 \;\wedge\notag\\
    &y_2 \equiv y \mbox{ mod } x_1 \;\wedge\;A \equiv a \mbox{ mod } x_1\;\wedge\notag\\
    &y_2 \equiv z \mbox{ mod } 2y\;\wedge\;A \equiv 1 \mbox{ mod } 2y\;\wedge\;y_1\equiv 0 \mbox{ mod } y^2\notag
   \end{align}
  Based on this result we prove that the equality $y = x^z$ is diophantin.
  For this purpose we justify that for a given $x$, $y$, $z$ that $y = x^z$
  if and only if
  \begin{align}
    & (y = 1 \wedge z = 0) \;\vee\notag\\
    & (x = 0 \wedge y = 0 \wedge z > 0) \;\vee\;(x = 1 \wedge y = 1 \wedge z > 0) \;\vee\notag\\
    &(x > 1 \wedge z > 0 \wedge \exists_{ y_1,y_2,y_3,K \in\mathbb{N}}\notag\\
     & \strut\mkern50mu   y_1 = y_{z+1}(x) \wedge K > 2zy_1 \wedge y_2 = y_{z+1}(K) \wedge y_3 = y_{z+1}(Kx) \wedge\notag\\
    &  \strut\mkern50mu   (0 \leq y-\frac{y_3}{y_2} <\frac{1}{2} \vee 0 \leq \frac{y_3}{y_2} -y < \frac{1}{2})).\notag
   \end{align}
