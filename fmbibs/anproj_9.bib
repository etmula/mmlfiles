    SUMMARY = {Using the Mizar system \cite{Mizar:2015}, we formalized that
    homographies of the projective real plane (as defined
    in \cite{ANPROJ_8.ABS}), form a group.
    \par
    Then, we prove that, using the notations of Borsuk and Szmielew in \cite{BORSUK:1}:
    "Consider in space $\mathbb{RP}^2$ points $P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4$ of which three points
    are not collinear and points $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3,Q_4$ each three points of which are also
    not collinear. There exists one homography $h$ of space $\mathbb{RP}^2$ such that
    $h(P_i)=Q_i$ for $i = 1,2,3,4$." (Existence Statement 52 and Existence Statement 53)
    \cite{BORSUK:1}. Or, using notations of Richter \cite{richter2011perspective}:
    "Let $[a]$, $[b]$, $[c]$, $[d]$ in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ be four points of which no three
    are collinear and let $[a']$,$[b']$,$[c']$,$[d']$ in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ be another four
    points of which no three are collinear, then there exists a
    $3\times 3$ matrix $M$ such that $[Ma] = [a']$, $[Mb] = [b']$, $[Mc]$ = $[c']$,
    and $[Md] = [d']$.
    \par
    Makarios has formalized the same results in Isabelle/Isar (the collineations form a group,
    lemma statement52-existence and lemma statement 53-existence) and published it
    in Archive of Formal Proofs \cite{makarios2012mechanical,Tarskis_Geometry-AFP},
