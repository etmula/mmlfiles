  SUMMARY = {In this article, we described the differential
  equations on functions from $\mathbbR$ into Real Banach space.
  The descriptions were based on the article \cite{ORDEQ_01.ABS}.
  As preliminary to prove these theorems, we proved some properties
  of differentiable functions on Real normed space. For the proof we
  referred to descriptions and theorems in the article
  \cite{NDIFF_4.ABS} and the article \cite{NDIFF_5.ABS}.
  And applying the theorems of Riemann integral introduced
  in the article \cite{INTEGR21.ABS}, we proved the ordinary
  differential equations on Real Banach space. We referred
  to the methods of proof in Schwarz \cite{LSchwarz:1967}.}}
