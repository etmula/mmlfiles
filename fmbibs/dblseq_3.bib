  SUMMARY = {In this article we introduce some convergence for
  an extended real-valued double sequence \cite{FOLLAND}, \cite{GARLING:1}.
  They are similar to our previous articles \cite{DBLSEQ_1.ABS},
  \cite{DBLSEQ_2.ABS}.
  In addition, we also prove the Fatou's lemma and the monotone
  convergence theorem for double sequences.},
