  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize some basic facts of $\mathbb Z$-module.
  In the first section, we discuss the rank of submodule of $\mathbb Z$-module and its properties.
  Especially, we formally prove that the rank of any $\mathbb Z$-module
  is equal to or more than that of its submodules,
  and vice versa, there exists a submodule with any given rank that satisfies the above condition.
  In the next section, we mention basic facts of linear transformations between two $\mathbb Z$-modules.
  In this section, we define homomorphism between two $\mathbb Z$-modules
  and deal with kernel and image of homomorphism.
  In the last section, we formally prove some basic
  facts about linearly independent subsets and linear combinations.},
