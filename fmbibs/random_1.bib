  SUMMARY = {In the various branches of science, probability 
  and randomness provide us with useful theoretical frameworks. 
  The {\it Formalized Mathematics} has already published some 
  articles concerning the probability: \cite{PROB_2.ABS}, 
  \cite{PROB_1.ABS}, \cite{RPR_1.ABS}, and \cite{PROB_4.ABS}. 
  In order to apply those articles, we shall give some theorems 
  concerning the probability and the real-valued random variables 
  to prepare for further studies.}}
