      SUMMARY = {We extend the algebraic theory of ordered fields
                 in Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015,FourDecades,AlgHierarchy}:
                 We show that every preordering can be extended into an
                 ordering, i.e. that formally real and ordered fields coincide.
                 We also prove some charactarizations of formally real fields,
                 in particular the one by Artin and Schreier using sums of squares.
                 In the second part of the article we define absolute values
                 and the square root function.}}
