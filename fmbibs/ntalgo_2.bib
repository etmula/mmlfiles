  SUMMARY = {In this article we formalize the maximum number of steps taken by some number theoretical
             algorithms, Right--to--left binary Algorithm for modular exponentiation
             and Euclidean Algorithm\cite{KNUTH2}. For any natural numbers $a$,$b$,$n$,
             Right--to--left binary Algorithm can calculate the natural number
             \verb+ ALGO_BPOW+$(a,n,m):=a^b \bmod n$ and  for any integers $a$,$b$,
             Euclidean Algorithm can calculate the non negative integer ${\text gcd}(a,b)$.
             We have not formalized computational complexity of algorithms yet,
             though we had already formalize the Euclidean Algorithm in \cite{NTALGO_1.ABS}.
             For Right-to-left binary Algorithm, we formalize the theorem, which says
             that the required number of the modular squares and modular products in
              this algorithms are  $1+\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$ and for Euclidean
              Algorithm,  we formalize the Lam\acute{e}'s theorem \cite{LAME}, which says the required
              number of the divisions in this algorithm is at most
              $5 \log_{10} \min(|a|,|b|)$.
              Our aim is to support the implementation of number theoretic tools and
              evaluating computational complexities of algorithms to prove the security of
              cryptographic systems.},
