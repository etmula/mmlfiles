  SUMMARY = {In this article we formalize rational functions as pairs
             of polynomials and define some basic notions including
             degree and evaluation of rational functions \cite{HH90}.
             The main goal of the article is to provide properties of
             rational functions necessary to prove a theorem on the
             stability of networks.}}
