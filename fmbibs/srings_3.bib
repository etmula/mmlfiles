  SUMMARY = {In this article, semi-ring and semi-algebra of sets are formalized
  so as to construct a measure of a given set in the next step.
  Although a semi-ring of sets has already been formalized in
  \cite{SRINGS_1.ABS}, that is, strictly speaking, a definition of
  a quasi semi-ring of sets suggested in the last few decades
  \cite{GOGUADZE:2003}. We adopt a classical definition of a semi-ring of
  sets here to avoid such a confusion. Ring of sets and algebra
  of sets have been formalized as \verb!non empty preBoolean! set
  \cite{FINSUB_1.ABS} and \verb!Field_Subset!
  \cite{PROB_1.ABS}, respectively.
  In the second section, definitions of a ring and a $\sigma$-ring of sets, which
  are based on a semi-ring and a ring of sets respectively, are formalized and
  their related theorems are proved.
  In the third section, definitions of an algebra and a $\sigma$-algebra of sets,
  which are based on a semi-algebra and an algebra of sets respectively, are
  formalized and their related theorems are proved.
  In the last section, mutual relationships between $\sigma$-ring and
  $\sigma$-algebra
  of sets are formalized and some related examples are given.},
