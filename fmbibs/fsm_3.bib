  SUMMARY = {Based on concepts introduced in \cite{REWRITE3.ABS}, 
  semiautomata and left-languages, automata and right-languages, 
  and langauges accepted by automata are defined. The powerset 
  construction is defined for transition systems, semiautomata 
  and automata. Finally, the equivalence of deterministic and 
  nondeterministic epsilon automata is shown.}}
