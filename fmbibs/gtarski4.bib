  SUMMARY = {In the article, we continue \cite{GTARSKI3.ABS} the formalization
  of the work devoted to Tarski's geometry -- the book ``Metamathematische Methoden
  in der Geometrie" by W. Schwabh\"auser, W. Szmielew, and A. Tarski
  \cite{schwabhauser2013metamathematische,DBLP:conf/fedcsis/Grabowski16,
    DBLP:conf/cikm/GrabowskiC16}.
  We use the Mizar system \cite{Mizar-State-2015},
  \cite{BancerekJAR:2018} to systematically formalize
  Chapter 8 (``Rechte Winkel -- Right angle") of the SST book.\par
  Note that in this case, the definition of the ``right angle" is $a$,$b$,$c$ bilden einen
  \textit{rechten winkel} (mit dem \textit{Scheitel $b$}):
  $$Rabc:\longleftrightarrow ac\equiv aS_b(c)$$.\par
  In this article:
  \begin{verbatim}
  definition
 let S be satisfying_CongruenceIdentity
    satisfying_CongruenceSymmetry
                     satisfying_CongruenceEquivalenceRelation
    satisfying_SegmentConstruction
                     satisfying_BetweennessIdentity
    satisfying_SAS TarskiGeometryStruct;
    let a,b,c be POINT of S;
    pred right_angle a,b,c means
    a,c equiv a,reflection(b,c);
  end;
  \end{verbatim}
  where \verb!reflection! is defined in \cite{GTARSKI3.ABS}.\par
  The theorems of chapter 8 are valid in neutral geometry \cite{GTARSKI1.ABS}.\par
  In 2006, the first eight chapters were formalised in Coq in 2006 by Narboux
  \cite{10.1007/978-3-540-77356-6_9}.
  The entire SST book have been formalized within intuitionistic logic
  \cite{boutry:hal-01483457}.
  (Note that the definition \cite{GeoCoqDefPER}, \cite{boutry2019parallel},
  \begin{verbatim}
  (* Definition 8.1. *)
  Definition Per A B C := exists C', Midpoint B C C' /\ Cong A C A   C'.
  \end{verbatim}
   and in \cite{Beeson2019}:  $ABC$ is a right angle if there is a point $D$ such that $  \textbf{B}(A, B, D)$ and $AB = DB$ and $AC=DC$:
  \begin{verbatim}
  rightangle      `RR A B C <=> ?X. BE A B X   /\ EE A B X B /\ EE A C X C /\ NE B C`
  \end{verbatim}\par
  Some of the results were obtained by means of other automatic proof assistants,
  either partially \cite{dhurdjevic2015automated}, or completely \cite{beeson2014otter}.},

abstract="We used computer proof-checking methods to verify the correctness of our proofs of the propositions in Euclid Book I. We used axioms as close as possible to those of Euclid, in a language closely related to that used in Tarski's formal geometry.
 We used proofs as close as possible to those given by Euclid, but filling Euclid's gaps and correcting errors. Euclid Book I has 48 propositions; we proved 235 theorems. The extras were partly ``Book Zero'', preliminaries of a very fundamental nature, pa
rtly propositions that Euclid omitted but were used implicitly, partly advanced theorems that we found necessary to fill Euclid's gaps, and partly just variants of Euclid's propositions. We wrote these proofs in a simple fragment of first-order logic corr
esponding to Euclid's logic, debugged them using a custom software tool, and then checked them in the well-known and trusted proof checkers HOL Light and Coq.",
