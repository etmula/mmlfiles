  SUMMARY = {This article formalizes the proof of Niven's theorem which
  states that if $x/\pi$ and $sin x$ are both rational, then the sine takes
  values $0$, $\pm 1/2$, and $\pm 1$. The main part of the formalization follows
  the informal proof presented at Pr$\infty$fWiki
  (\url{https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Niven's_Theorem#Source_of_Name}).
  For this proof, we have also formalized the rational and integral root
  theorems setting constraints on solutions of polynomial equations with
  integer coefficients.}}
