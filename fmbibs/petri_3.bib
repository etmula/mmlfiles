  SUMMARY = {Based on the Petri net definitions and theorems already
  formalized in the Mizar article \cite{PETRI.ABS},
  in this article we were able to formalize
  the definition of Cell Petri nets. It is based on \cite{Kawamoto}.
  Colored Petri net is already have been defined in
  \cite{PETRI_2.ABS}. In addition the conditions
  of the firing-rule and ColoredSet to this definition,
  that defines the Cell Petri nets extended to CPNT.i further.
  Although it was synthesis of two Petri nets in \cite{PETRI_2.ABS},
  it is synthesis from the family of Colored Petri nets
  (Colored-PT-net-Family of I) of finite number of pieces.
  That is, extension to a CPNT family is performed by defining
  the output arc from the transition of a certain Colored Petri nets
  to Place of a certain another Colored Petri nets
  (definition of the neighborhood).
  Finally, activation of Colored Petri nets was formalized.}}
