  SUMMARY = {
In this paper we present a~formalization in the Mizar system \cite{FourDecades,BancerekJAR:2018}
of the partial correctness of the algorithm
\begin{verbatim}
i := val.1
j := val.2
n := val.3
s := val.4
while ( i <> n )
 i := i + j
 s := s * i
return s
\end{verbatim}
computing the factorial of given natural number \texttt{n},
where variables {\tt i, n, s} are located as values of a~{\tt V-valued Function}, {\tt loc}, as: 
\verb!loc/.1 = i!, \verb!loc/.3 = n! and \verb!loc/.4 = s!,
and the constant {\tt 1} is located in the location \verb!loc/.2 = j! (set {\tt V} represents simple names of considered nominative data \cite{Skobelev2014}).\par
This work continues a~formal verification of algorithms written in terms of simple-named complex-valued nominative data \cite{NOMIN_1.ABS,NOMIN_2.ABS,PARTPR_1.ABS,PARTPR_2.ABS,DBLP:conf/fedcsis/KornilowiczKNI17,DBLP:conf/isat/KornilowiczKNI17}.
The validity of the algorithm is presented in terms of semantic Floyd-Hoare triples over such data \cite{NOMIN_3.ABS}.
Proofs of the correctness are based on an~inference system for an~extended Floyd-Hoare logic \cite{Floyd1967,Hoare1969} with partial pre- and post-conditions \cite{KornilowiczetalICTERI2017,Kryvolap2013,Moldova2018,SeqRule2018}.
