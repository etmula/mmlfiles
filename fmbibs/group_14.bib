  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize that every finite cyclic
    group is isomorphic to a direct product of finite cyclic groups
    which orders are relative prime. This theorem is closely related
    to the Chinese Remainder theorem (\cite{INT_6.ABS}) and is a useful
    lemma to prove the basis theorem for finite abelian groups and
    the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups. Moreover, we
    formalize some facts about the product of a finite sequence of
    abelian groups.}}
