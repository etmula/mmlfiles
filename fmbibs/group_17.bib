  SUMMARY = {We have been working on the formalization of groups.
  In \cite{GROUP_14.ABS}, we encoded some theorems concerning
  the product of cyclic groups. In this article, we present
  the generalized formalization of \cite{GROUP_14.ABS}.
  First, we show that every finite commutative group which
  order is composite number is isomorphic to a direct
  product of finite commutative groups which orders are relative prime.
  Next, we describe finite direct products of finite commutative groups.}}
