  SUMMARY = {We start proceeding with stopping time theory in discrete time.
             We show, the necessity in
             (\cite{follmerschied:2004},p.283), that in general the expression
             for two stopping times tau1,tau2 not always implies
             a stoppingtime (tau1+tau2). This means you have to cut it
             - (tau+sigma)/\T (in the case of finity) -.
             Next we introduce stopping time in continuouos time.
             Here we are focused on the time intervales [.0.r.] where r in REAL
             and [.0,+infty.[ We prove some Borel-Sets,more general given in
             (\cite{georgii:2004}, p.~12 1.8,(e)). These Borel-Sets are neccessary
             to define our nex theorem. In the case of continuity we show, that
             the \sigma-algebra of the \tau-past, where \tau is a
             stopping time has a certain characteristic
             (\cite{klenke:2006}, p.~187, Definition 9,19 and Lemma 9.21).
             Stopping Times can be used together with the conditional
             expected value. Look as an example to the Optional Sampling
             Theorem in \cite{klenke:2006}, p.~203.}}
