  SUMMARY = {In this article, the isomorphisms from the space of
     multilinear operators are discussed.
    In the first chapter, two isomorphisms are formalized.
    The former isomorphism shows the correspondence between the space
    of multilinear operators and the space of bilinear operators.
    The latter shows the correspondence between the space of
    multilinear operators and the space of the composition of linear
    operators.
    In the last chapter, the above isomorphisms are extended to
    isometric mappings between the normed spaces.
    We referred to \cite{miyadera:1972}, \cite{yoshida:1980},
    \cite{Schwartz1997a}, \cite{Schwartz1997b} in this formalization.},
  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT = {I would like to express my gratitude to Professor
  Yasunari Shidama for his helpful advice.}}
