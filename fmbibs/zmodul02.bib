  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize
 a quotient module of $\mathbb Z$-module and a vector space constructed by
 the quotient module.
 We formally prove that for a $\mathbb Z$-module $V$ and a prime number $p$,
 a quotient module $V / p V$ has the structure of a vector space over
 $\mathbb{F}_p$.
 $\mathbb Z$-module is necessary for lattice problems,
 LLL (Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov\'asz) base reduction algorithm
 and cryptographic systems with lattices \cite{LAT}.
 Some theorems in this article are described by translating
 theorems in \cite{RLVECT_2.ABS} and \cite{RLVECT_3.ABS}
 into theorems of $\mathbb Z$-module.}}
