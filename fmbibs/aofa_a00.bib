  SUMMARY = {We introduce an algebra with free variables, an algebra with
    undefined values, a program algebra over a term algebra, an algebra with integers, and
    an algebra with arrays.
    Program algebra is defined as universal algebra with assignments.
    Programs depens on the set of generators with supported variables and
    supported terms which determine the value of free variables in next state.
    The execution of a program is changing state according to successor function
    using supported terms.}}
