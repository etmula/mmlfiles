  SUMMARY = {Representation of a non zero integer as a signed product of primes is unique similarly to
  its representations in various types of positional notations
  \cite{Gancarzewicz2000}, \cite{Erdos2003}.
  The study focuses on counting the prime factors of integers in
  the form of sums or differences of two equal powers (thus
  being represented by 1 and a series of zeroes
  in respective digital bases).}}
