  SUMMARY = {Schmets \cite{Schmets:2004} has developed a measure
  theory from a generalized notion of a semiring of sets.
  Goguadze \cite{GOGUADZE:2003} has introduced another generalized
  notion of semiring of sets and prove that all know properties that
  semiring have according to the old definitions are preserved.
  We show that this two notions are almost equivalent.
  We note that Patriota \cite{2011arXiv1103.6166P} told these
  quasi-semi-ring. We propose the formalization of some properties
  developed by the authors.}}
