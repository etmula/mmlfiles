  SUMMARY = {This is the translation of Mizar article
  containing readable Mizar proofs of some axiomatic
  geometry theorems due
 to the great Polish mathematician Alfred Tarski (born Teitelbaum)
 \cite{TarskiGivant}, and
 we hope to continue this work. The first author ported the code to
 HOL Light (\url{http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/}), which can be
 found in any recent subversion of HOL Light as
 \url{hol_light/RichterHilbertAxiomGeometry/TarskiAxiomGeometry_read.ml}.
  \par
  The article is an extension and upgrading of the source code
  written by the first author with the help of \verb!miz3! tool;
  his primary goal was to use proof checkers to help
  teach rigorous axiomatic geometry in high school using Hilbert's axioms.
  \par
  This is largely a Mizar port of Julien Narboux's Coq pseudo-code
  \cite{Narboux:2007}.
  We partially prove the theorem of \cite{Schwabhauser:1983}
  that Tarski's
  (extremely weak!) plane geometry axioms imply Hilbert's axioms.  He
  got about as far as Narboux, with Gupta's amazing proof which
  implies Hilbert's axiom I1 that two points determine a line.
  \par
  The primary Mizar coding was heavily influenced by \cite{INCSP_1.ABS}
  on axioms of incidence geometry.
  The original development was much improved using Mizar adjectives
  instead of predicates only, and to use this machinery in full extent,
  we have to construct some models of Tarski geometry. These are listed
  in the second section, together with appropriate registrations of
  clusters. Also models of Tarski's geometry related to real planes
  were constructed.}}
