  SUMMARY = {Drawing a finite graph is usually done by a finite sequence of the following three operations.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw a vertex of the graph.
  \item Draw an edge between two vertices of the graph.
  \item Draw an edge starting from a vertex of the graph and immediately draw a vertex at the other end of   it.
  \end{enumerate}
  By this procedure any finite graph can be constructed. This property of graphs is so
  obvious that the author of this article has yet to find a reference where it is
  mentioned explicitly. In introductionary books (like \cite{SIMPLE}, \cite{MULTI})
  as well as in advanced ones (like \cite{SELECTED}), after the initial definition of graphs
  the examples are usually given by graphical representations rather than explicit
  set theoretic descriptions, assuming a mutual understanding how the representation is
  to be translated into a description fitting the definition. However, Mizar does not
  possess this innate ability of humans to translate pictures into graphs. Therefore, if
  one wants to create graphs in Mizar without directly providing a set theoretic description
  (i.e. using the {\texttt{createGraph}} functor), a rigorous approach to the constructing
  operations is required.\par
  In this paper supergraphs are defined as an inverse mode to subgraphs as given in
  \cite{GLIB_000.ABS}. The three graph construction operations are defined as modes
  extending {\texttt{Supergraph}} similar to how the various remove operations
  were introduced as submodes of {\texttt{Subgraph}} in \cite{GLIB_000.ABS}. Many theorems
  are proven that describe how graph properties are transferred to special supergraphs.
  In particular, to prove that disconnected graphs cannot become connected by adding
  an edge between two vertices that lie in the same component, the theory of replacing
  a part of a walk with another walk is introduced in the preliminaries.}
