    SUMMARY = {In this article, we check with the Mizar system \cite{Mizar-State-2015},
  the Pascal's theorem in the real projective plane.
  ("In projective geometry, Pascal's theorem (also known as the Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem)
  states that if six arbitrary points are chosen on a conic
  (i.e., ellipse, parabola or hyperbola) and joined by line segments in any order
  to form a hexagon, then the three pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon (extended if necessary)
  meet in three points which lie on a straight line,
  called the Pascal line of the hexagon."
  \footnote{WIKIPEDIA, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_theorem}).
  Pappus's theorem is the special case of a degenerate conic of two lines.\par
  For proving the Pascal's theorem, we use the technics developped in
  the section "Projective Proofs of Pappus’s Theorem" in
  the chapter "Pappos’s Theorem: Nine proofs and three variations"
  \cite{Richter-Gebert2011}. We also follow some ideas from Harrison's work.
  With HOL/Light, he has proof the Pascal theorem
  \footnote{https://github.com/gilith/hol-light/blob/master/100/pascal.ml}.\par
  For a lemma, we use \verb?PROVER9?\footenote{https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/} and \verb?OTT2MIZ?   by Josef Urban,
  \footnote{See its homepage https://github.com/JUrban/ott2miz}\cite{rudnicki2011escape,grabowski2006solving,grabowski2015mechanizing}.
  We note that we don't use Skolem/Herbrand functions(see ``Skolemization''
  in \cite{alama2012escape}.}
