  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize some properties on vector spaces
  over a ring.  We formally prove the 1st isomorphism theorem on vector spaces
  over a ring.
  We also formalize the product space of vector spaces.
  $\mathbb Z$-module is necessary for lattice problems,
  LLL (Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov\'asz) base reduction algorithm
  and cryptographic systems with lattice \cite{LAT}.
  Some theorems in this article are described by translating
  theorems in \cite{RANKNULL.ABS}, \cite{ZMODUL05.ABS},
  and \cite{ZMODUL07.ABS}
  into theorems of vector spaces over a ring.},
