  SUMMARY = {We calculate the values of the trigonometric functions
  for angles: $\frac{\pi}{3}$ and $\frac{\pi}{6}$. After some trigonometric identities,
  we demonstrate conventional trigonometric formulas in the triangle,
  and the geometric property of the triangle inscribed in a semicircle.
  Then we define the diameter of the circumscribed circle of a triangle
  using the definition of the area of a triangle and prove some
  identities of a triangle. We conclude by indicating that a diameter
  of a circle is twice as long as the length of the radius.}}
