  SUMMARY = {We consider special events of Borel-Sets with the aim to prove,
             that IRRAT is an Event of the Borel-Sets. NAT, INT and RAT are
             countable, so we can use the literature \cite{analysis1:2001}
             (p. 78-81) as a basis for the similar construction of the proof.
             Next we prove, that different sets can construct the Borel-Sets
             \cite{klenke:2006} (p. 9-10). The literatures \cite{klenke:2006}
             (p. 9-10) and \cite{georgii:2004} (p. 11-12) give an overview,
             that there exists some other sets for this construction. Last we
             define special functions as Random-Variables for Stochastic
             Finance in discrete time. The relevant functions are implemented
             in the Finance1-Article, see \cite{follmerschied:2004} (p. 4). The
             aim is to construct Events and Random-Variables, which can easily
             be used with a Probability-Measure. See as an example theorem
             RANDOM_3:10 and RANDOM_3:14 where a random-variable is used with a
             Probability-Measure. Then the formalization is more similar to the
             presentation used in the book \cite{follmerschied:2004}. }}
