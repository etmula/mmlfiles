  SUMMARY = {In this article we prove several basic theorems that correspond to the Pell's Equation.
  First we focus on the theorem that the Pell's equation $x^2-Dy^2 = 1$ has
  infinitely many solutions in positive integers for a given non square natural number $D$.
  We present also a formalization of a theorem that based on the least fundamental
  solution of the equation we can simply calculate algebraically each remaining solution.
  \par The formalization follows W. Sierpi蘒ッki \cite{Sierpinski64}.
  Solutions to Pell's Equation are listed as \#39 at Freek Wiedijk's
  list of ``Top 100 mathematical theorems" \cite{Freek-100-theorems}.}}
