  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize polynomially bounded sequences
            that plays an important role in computational complexity theory.
            The class P is a fundamental  computational complexity class that
            contains all polynomial-time decision problems \cite{ALDESIGN}.
            It takes polynomially bounded amount of computation
            time to solve polynomial-time decision problems
            by a deterministic Turing machine.
            Moreover we formalize polynomial sequences.},
