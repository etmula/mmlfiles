  SUMMARY = {In this article, we discuss on the continuity of bounded linear operators on normed linear    spaces.
            In the first section, it is discussed that bounded linear operators on normed linear spaces are    uniformly continuous and Lipschitz continuous.
            Especially, a bounded linear operator on the dense subset of a complete normed linear space has   a unique natural extension over the whole space.
            In the next section, several basic currying properties are formalized.
            In the last section, we formalized that continuity of bilineaer operator is equivalent to both   Lipschitz continuity and local continuity.
            We referred to \cite{miyadera:1972}, \cite{yoshida:1980}, and \cite{Dunford:1958} in this   formalization.},
