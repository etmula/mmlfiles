  SUMMARY = {This article provides a formalized proof of
  the so-called "the four-square theorem",
  namely any natural number can be expressed by the sum
  of four integer squares, which was proved by Lagrange in 1770.
  A written proof of the theorem can be found in a book
  on number theory
  such as \cite{HardyWright} or \cite{Baker:1984}.
  \par
  The theorem is listed \#19 on Freek Wiedijk's "Top 100 mathematical
  theorems" list.}}
