  SUMMARY = {Solving equations in integers is an important
  part of number theory \cite{sierpinski1956}.
  In many cases it can be done by factorization of equation's
  elements, such as Newton's binomial.
  The article introduces several simple formulas, which
  may facilitate this process.
  Some of them are taken from relevant books \cite{sierpinski1950},
  \cite{gancarzewicz2000}.
  \par
  In the second section of the article,
  Fermat's Little Theorem is proved in a classical way,
  on the basis of divisibility of Newton's binomial.
  Although slightly redundant in its content (other proof of
  the theorem has earlier been included in \cite{EULER_2.ABS}),
  the article provides a good example, how the application of
  registrations could shorten the length of Mizar
  proofs \cite{caminati2013custom}, \cite{kornilowicz2013rewriting}.}}
