  SUMMARY = {Formalization of a part of \cite{JouannaudLescanne}.
  Unfortunately, not all is able to be formalized.
  Namely, in the paper is mistake in the proof of Lemma 3.
  There is stated that there exists $x\in M_1$ such that $M_1(x)>N_1(x)$ and
  $(\forall y\in N_1)x\not\prec y$. There should be $M_1(x)\geq N_1(x)$.
  Nevertheless we do not know whether $x\in N_1$ or not and cannot prove the
  contradiction.}}
