SUMMARY = {This article introduces propositional logic as a formal system
  (\cite{AniWas}).
  The formulae of the language are as follows
  $\phi::=\,\,\perp|\, p\,|\,\phi\rightarrow\phi$.
  Other connectives are introduced as abbrevations. The notions of model and satisfaction
  in model are defined. The axioms are all the formulae of the following schemes
  $\alpha\Rightarrow(\beta\Rightarrow\alpha),\,
  (\alpha\Rightarrow(\beta\Rightarrow\gamma))\Rightarrow((\alpha\Rightarrow\beta)\Rightarrow
  (\alpha\Rightarrow\gamma)),\,(\neg\beta\Rightarrow\neg\alpha)\Rightarrow
  ((\neg\beta\Rightarrow\alpha)\Rightarrow\beta)$.
  Modus ponens is the only derivation rule. The soundness theorem and the strong completeness
  theorem are proved. The proof of the completeness theorem is carried out by a
  counter-model existence method. In order to prove the completeness theorem,
  Lindenbaum's Lemma is proved.
  Some most widely used tautologies are presented.}}
