  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize negligible functions that play an essential role in cryptology \cite{GOLDREICH,BELLARE}.
              Generally, a cryptosystem is secure if the probability of succeeding any attacks against the
              cryptosystem is negligible. First, we formalize the algebra of polynomially bounded sequences \cite{ASYMPT_2.ABS}. 
              Next, we formalize negligible functions and prove the set of negligible functions is a subset 
             of the algebra of polynomially bounded sequences. Moreover, we then introduce equivalence relation 
             between polynomially bounded sequences, using negligible functions.},
