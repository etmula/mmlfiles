  SUMMARY = {Fubini theorem is an essential tool for the analysis
  of high-dimensional space \cite{Halmos74}, \cite{Bauer:2002},
  \cite{Bogachev2007measure}, a theorem about the multiple
  integral and iterated integral. The authors have been working on
  formalizing Fubini's theorem over the past few years
  \cite{MEASUR11.ABS}, \cite{MESFUN12.ABS}. As a result, Fubini's theorem
  was proved in complete form by this article.}}
