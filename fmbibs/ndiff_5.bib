  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize differentiability of
  functions on normed linear spaces.
  Partial derivative, mean value theorem for vector-valued functions,
  continuous differentiability, etc. are formalized.
  As well known, there is no exact analog of the mean
  value theorem for vector-valued functions.
  However a certain type of generalization of the mean
  value theorem to for vector-valued functions is obtained as follows:
  If $||.D?(x + th).||$ is bounded for $t$ between 0 and 1
  by some constant $M,$ then  $||. f(x + th) - f(x).|| <= M ||.h.||.$
  This theorem is called the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions.
  By this theorem, the relation between the (total) derivative and
  the partial derivatives of a function is derived \cite{Schwartz}.},
