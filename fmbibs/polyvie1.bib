  SUMMARY = {In the article we formalized in the Mizar system
  \cite{Mizar-State-2015} the Vieta formula about the sum of
  roots of a~polynomial $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$
  defined over an~algebraically closed field.
  The formula says that
  $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{n-1} + x_n = -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}$.
  In the article the sum is denoted by \texttt{SumRoots}.},}
