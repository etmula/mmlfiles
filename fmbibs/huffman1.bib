  SUMMARY = {Huffman coding is one of a most famous entropy
    encoding methods for lossless data compression \cite{HUFFMAN52}.
    JPEG and ZIP formats employ variants of Huffman encoding as
    lossless compression algorithms.
    Huffman coding is a bijective map from source letters
    into leaves of the Huffman tree constructed by the algorithm.
    In this article, we formalize an algorithm
    constructing a binary code tree, Huffman tree.},
