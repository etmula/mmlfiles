  SUMMARY = {We introduce a new characterization of algebras of normal forms
of term rewriting systems \cite{KlopTRS} as
algebras of term free in itself (any function from the set of free generators into
the algebra generates endomorphism of the algebra).
Introduced algebras are free in classes
of algebras satisfying some sets of equalities. The universes of them are
subsets of all terms and the denotations of operation symbols are partially
identical with the operations of construction of terms.
These algebras are compiler algebras requiring some equalities of terms, e.g.,
associativity of addition.
