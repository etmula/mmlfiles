  SUMMARY = {In the article we continue in the Mizar system
  \cite{Mizar-State-2015} the formalization of 
  fuzzy implications according to the book of Baczy\'nski.
  We develop a framework of Mizar attributes allowing us for a 
  smooth proving of basic properties of impliactions.
  We also give a set of theorems about the ordering of these 
  important fuzzy operators.
  This work is a continuation of the development
  of fuzzy sets in Mizar \cite{GrabowskiFuzzy:2013};
  it could be used to give a variety of
  more general operations on fuzzy sets.},}
