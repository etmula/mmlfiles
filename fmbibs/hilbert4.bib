  SUMMARY = {An original result about Hilbert Positive Propositional
  Calculus introduced in \cite{HILBERT1.ABS} is proven.
  That is, it is shown that the pseudo-canonical formulae of
  that calculus (and hence also the canonical ones,
  see \cite{HILBERT3.ABS}) are a subset of the classical tautologies.}}
