  SUMMARY = {In this article we formalize the Bertrand's Ballot Theorem
             based on \cite{BALLOT}. Suppose that in an election we have
             two candidates: $A$ that receives $n$ votes and $B$ that
             receives $k$ votes, and additionaly $n\geq k$. Then this
             theorem states that the probability of the situation where
             $A$ maintains more votes than $B$ throughout the counting
             of the ballots is equal to $(n-k)/(n+k)$.
