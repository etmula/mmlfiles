  SUMMARY = {This article introduces labelled state transition systems, 
  where transitions may be labelled by words from a given alphabet.
  Reduction relations from \cite{REWRITE1.ABS} are used to define 
  transitions between states, acceptance of words, and reachable states. 
  Deterministic transition systems are also defined.}}
