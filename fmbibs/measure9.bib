  SUMMARY = {In our previous article \cite{MEASURE8.abs}, we showed complete additivity
  as a condition for extension of a measure. However, this condition is premised the existence
  of a sigma field and the measurer on it. In general, the existence of the measure on sigma
  field is not trivial. On the other hand, the existence of a measure on semi-algebra is
  easier than sigma field. Therefore, in this article we define a measure (pre-measure) on
  semi algebra and extend it to a measure on sigma field. Furthermore, we give a sigma
  measure as extension of the measure on sigma field. We follow \cite{Halmos74},
  \cite{Bogachev}, and \cite{Rao}.},
