  SUMMARY = {The notion of the characteristic of rings and its basic properties are formalized
  \cite{Jacobson2009}, \cite{Waerden2003}, \cite{Luneburg1999}.
  Classification of prime fields in terms of isomorphisms with
  appropriate fields ($\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/p$) are presented.
  To facilitate reasonings within the field of rational numbers,
  values of numerators and denominators of basic operations over rationals are computed.},
