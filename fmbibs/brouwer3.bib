  SUMMARY = {In this article we focus on a special case of the Brouwer invariance of domain theorem.
  Let us $A$, $B$ be a subsets of ${\cal E}^n$, and $f:A \rightarrow B$ be a homeomorphic.
  We prove that, if $A$ is closed then $f$ transform the boundary of $A$ to the boundary of $B$;
  and if $B$ is closed then $f$ transform the interior of $A$ to the interior of $B$.
  These two cases are sufficient to prove the topological invariance of dimension, which
  is used to prove a basic properties of the $n$-dimensional manifolds, and also
  to prove a basic properties of the boundary and the interior of manifolds, e.g.
  the boundary of an $n$-dimension manifold with boundary is an $(n - 1)$-dimension manifold. This article
             is based on \cite{DUDA:BM61};
             \cite{Engelking:1989},
             \cite{Engelking:1978} can also serve as reference books.}}
