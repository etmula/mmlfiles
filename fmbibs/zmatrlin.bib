  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize a matrix of $\mathbb Z$-module and
  its properties.  Specially, we formalize a matrix of a linear transformation
  of $\mathbb Z$-module, a bilinear form and a matrix of the bilinear form
  (Gramian matrix).  We formally prove that for a finite-rank free
  $\mathbb Z$-module $V$, determinant of its Gramian matrix is constant
  regardless of selection of its basis.
  $\mathbb Z$-module is necessary for lattice problems,
  LLL (Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov\'asz) base reduction algorithm
  and cryptographic systems with lattices \cite{LAT}.
  Some theorems in this article are described by translating
  theorems in \cite{MATRLIN.ABS}, \cite{HAHNBAN.ABS} and \cite{BILINEAR.ABS}
  into theorems of $\mathbb Z$-module.},
