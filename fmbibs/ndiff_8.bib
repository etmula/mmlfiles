  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalized existence and uniqueness part
    of implicit function theorem.
    In the first section, some composition properties of Lipschitz continuous linear function are discussed.
    In the second section, a definition of closed ball and
    theorems of several properties of open and closed sets in Banach
    space are described.
    In the last section, we formalized existence and uniqueness of continuous
    implicit function in Banach space using Banach fixed point theorem.
    We referred to \cite{Schwartz1997a}, \cite{Schwartz1997b},
    and \cite{driver2003} in this formalization.}}
