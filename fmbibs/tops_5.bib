  SUMMARY = {This article covers some technical aspects about the product topology 
   which are usually not given much of a thought in mathematics and standard literature 
  like \cite{MUNKRES} and \cite{KELLEY}, not even by Bourbaki in \cite{BOUR}. 
  Let $\{\mathcal T_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a family of topological spaces. The   
  prebasis of the product space $\mathcal T=\prod_{i\in I} \mathcal T_i$ is 
  defined in \cite{WAYBEL18.ABS} as the set of all $\pi^{-1}_i(V)$ with $i\in I$ 
  and $V$ open in $\mathcal T_i$. Here it is shown that the   
  basis generated by this prebasis consists exactly of the sets $\prod_{i\in I} V_i$ 
  with $V_i$ open in $ \mathcal T_i$ and for all but finitely many 
  $i\in I$ holds $V_i=\mathcal T_i$. Given $I=\{a\}$ we have $  \mathcal T\cong \mathcal T_a$, 
  given $I=\{a,b\}$ with $a\neq b$ we have $\mathcal T \cong \mathcal T_a   
  \times\mathcal T_b$. Given another family of topological spaces 
  $\{\mathcal S_i\}_{i\in I}$ such that $\mathcal S_i\cong\mathcal T_i$ 
  for all $i\in I$, we have $\mathcal S=\prod_{i\in I} \mathcal S_i\cong   
  \mathcal T$. If instead $S_i$ is a subspace of $T_i$ for each $i\in I$, 
  then $\mathcal S$ is a subspace of $\mathcal T$. These results are 
  obvious for mathematicians, but formally proven here.}}
