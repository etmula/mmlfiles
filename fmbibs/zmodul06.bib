  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize a torsion $\mathbb Z$-module and
  a torsion-free $\mathbb Z$-module.  Especially, we prove formally that
  finitely-generated torsion-free $\mathbb Z$-modules are finite-rank free.
  We also formalize properties related to rank of finite-rank free
  $\mathbb Z$-modules.
  The notion of $\mathbb Z$-module is necessary for solving
  lattice problems,
  LLL (Lenstra, Lenstra, and Lov\'asz) base reduction algorithm
  and cryptographic systems over lattices \cite{LAT}.},
