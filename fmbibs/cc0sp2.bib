  SUMMARY = {In this article, first we give a definition of a functional space which
  is constructed from all complex-valued continuous functions defined on a compact
  topological space. We prove that this functional space is a Banach algebra.
  Next, we give a definition of a function space which is constructed from all
  complex-valued continuous functions with bounded support. We also prove that this
  function space is a complex normed space.}
