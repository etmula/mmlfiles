  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize the Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES). AES, which is the most widely used symmetric
    cryptosystem in the world, is a block cipher that was selected
    by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    as an official Federal Information Processing Standard for the
    United States in 2001 \cite{FIPS:197}. AES is the successor to
    DES \cite{DESCIP_1.ABS}, which was formerly the most widely used
    symmetric cryptosystem in the world. We formalize the AES
    algorithm according to \cite{FIPS:197}. We then verify the
    correctness of the formalized algorithm that the ciphertext
    encoded by the AES algorithm can be decoded uniquely by the same
    key. Please note the following points about this formalization.
    The AES round process is composed of the SubBytes, ShiftRows,
    MixColumns, and AddRoundKey transformations. In this formalization,
    the SubBytes and MixColumns transformations are given as permutations,
    because it is necessary to treat the finite field GF($2^8$) for
    those transformations. The formalization of AES that considers
    the finite field GF($2^8$) is formalized by the future
    article.},
