  SUMMARY = {This is a second preliminary article to prove completeness
  theorem of propositional temporal logic. We introduce two modified
  definitions of a subformula. In the first one we treat until-formula
  as indivisible. In the second one we extend set
  of subformulas of until-formulas by special disjunctive formula.
  This is needed to construct a temporal model. We also define
  an ordered positive-negative pair of finite sequences of formulas
  (PNP). PNPs represent states of a temporal model.}}
