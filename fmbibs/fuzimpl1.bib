  SUMMARY = {In the article we present in the Mizar system
  \cite{Mizar-State-2015} the catalogue of nine basic
  fuzzy implications,
  used especially in the theory of fuzzy sets \cite{Zadeh:1965}.
  This work is a continuation of the development
  of fuzzy sets in Mizar \cite{GrabowskiFuzzy:2013};
  it could be used to give a variety of
  more general operations on fuzzy sets.},}
