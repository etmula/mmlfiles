  SUMMARY = {In contrast to other proving systems Mizar Mathematical Library
  is maintained as a single base of theorems, which allows the users
  to benefit from earlier formalized items \cite{Bancerek2017}. This
  eventually leads to a development of certain
  branches of articles using common notation and ideas. Such formalism for
  finite sequences has been developed since 1989 \cite{FINSEQ_1.ABS} and
  further developed despite of the controversy over indexing which
  excludes zero \cite{Rudnicki2003}.
  The article aims to add some new machinery for
  dealing with finite sequences, especially those of short length.}}
