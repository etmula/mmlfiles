  SUMMARY = {Gaussian integer is one of basic algebraic integers.
  In this article, we formalize some definitions about Gaussian integers
  \cite{Weil79}.
  We also formalize ring (called Gaussian integer ring), Z-module and
  Z-algebra generated by Gaussian integer mentioned above.
  Moreover, we formalize some definitions about Gaussian rational
  numbers and Gaussian rational number field.
  Then we prove that the Gaussian rational number field and a quotient field
  of the Gaussian integer ring are isomorphic.},
