 SUMMARY = {In this article we extend the algebraic theory of polynomial
   rings. After introducing constant and monic polynomials we
   present the canonical embedding of $R$ into $R[X]$ and deal with
   both unit and irreducible elements. We also define polynomial gcds
   and show that for fields $F$ and irreducible polynomials $p$ the
   field $F[X}\slash<p>$ is isomorphic to the field of polynomials with
   degree smaller than the one of $p$.}}
