  SUMMARY = {This article is the second in a series
  of two Mizar articles constituting a formal
  proof of the G\"odel Completeness theorem
  \cite{G\"odel:1930)} for uncountably large
  languages. We follow the proof given in \cite{Ebbinghaus2007}.
  The present article contains the techniques required to expand
  a theory such that the expanded theory contains witnesses
  and is negation faithful. Then the completeness theorem
  follows immediately.}}
