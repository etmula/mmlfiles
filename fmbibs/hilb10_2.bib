  SUMMARY = {In this article, we define Diophantine sets using the Mizar formalism.
  We focus on selected properties of multivariate polynomials, i.e.,  functions of several variables
  to show finally that the class of Diophantine sets is closed with  respect to the operations of union and intersection.
  \par This article is the next in a series aiming to formalize
  the proof of Matiyasevich's negative solution of Hilbert's
  tenth problem.},
  INTRODUCTION={
  Multivariate polynomials are often interpreted in informal  mathematical practice
  as
  a finite sum of terms with each term being a product of a nonzero  coefficient $c\in\mathfrak{F}\setminus\{{\bf 0}\}$ and
  a monomial $x_1^{e_1}\cdot x_2^{e_2}\cdot \ldots \cdot x_n^{e_n}$  determined by an exponent vector $\langle e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_n\rangle\in  \mathbb{N}^n$
  where $n$ is a given natural number.
  \par
  Formal interpretation of multivariate polynomials developed in the Mizar
  Mathematical Library \cite{FourDecades}
  can be considered as a generalization of the informal approach, where  the natural number $n$ is replaced by an ordinal number $\lambda$.
  Additionally, to avoid problems that occur when multiplying an  infinite number of nonzero factors,
  each exponent vector $e:\lambda\mapsto\mathbb{N}$ has only a finite  number of nonzero coordinates.
  Such exponent vectors are called \textit{bags} of  $\lambda$ and the  set of all bags for a given $\lambda$ is denoted by
  \textit{Bags} $\lambda$.
  It is important to note that for a finite $\lambda$,
  each bag $b$ corresponds to a finite sequence (with $0$-based numbering).
  Using bags, multivariate polynomials have been defined in \cite{POLYNOM1.ABS}
  as functions that assign a coefficient (an element of $\mathfrak{F}$)  to each bag of $\lambda$ and are zero almost
  everywhere. Moreover, the evaluation for a multivariate polynomial $p$
  and vector ${x}:\lambda\mapsto\mathfrak{F}$  has been defined as
  \begin{equation}
  \mbox{eval}(p,{x}) = \displaystyle\sum_{b\in {Bags}\,\lambda} p(b)\:
  \cdot\:  \prod_{i \in \lambda}x(i)^{b(i)}.
  \end{equation}\par
  Based on this approach we define Diophantine sets in Def.~\ref{def6}  as follows.
  Let us consider a natural number $n$ that plays the role of the dimension and
   a subset $D$ of all finite sequences of length $n$ numbered from $0$  (see Def.~\ref{def5}).
  We call $D$ {\it Diophantine} if there exist a natural number $k$ and  a $n\!+\!k$--variable polynomial $p$ such that
  each coefficient is an integer number and
  \begin{equation}
  \forall_{{x}:n\mapsto \mathbb{N}} \,{x}\in D \:\Longleftrightarrow\:
  \exists_{{y}:k\mapsto \mathbb{N}}\, \mbox{eval}(p,{x}^\smallfrown{y})=0.
  \end{equation}
  \par The main aim of our article is to show that
  the union and intersection of two $n$--dimension Diophantine sets $D_1$, $D_2$
  is also Diophantine. The informal proof of these facts as presented by  Z. Adamowicz and  P. Zbierski in \cite{AdamowiczZbierski}
  is quite obvious. Suppose that $p_i$ is $n+k_i$--variable polynomial  which determines $D_i$ for $i=1,2$.
  Then $p^\prime_1\cdot p^\prime_2$ determines $D_1\cap D_2$ and  $(p^\prime_1)^2+ (p^\prime_2)^2$ determines $D_1\cup D_2$
  where $p^\prime_i$ is the $n+k_1+k_2$--variable polynomial obtained  from $p_i$ by modifying the order of variables
  and adding insignificant variables. The property of $p^\prime_1,  p^\prime_2$, used in \cite{AdamowiczZbierski}
  can be formally formulated as follows:
  \begin{equation}
  \mbox{eval}(p^\prime_1,x^\smallfrown{y_1}^\smallfrown{y_2})=\mbox{eval}(p_1,x^\smallfrown{y_1})\;\wedge\;
  \mbox{eval}(p^\prime_2,x^\smallfrown{y_1}^\smallfrown{y_2})=\mbox{eval}(p_2,x^\smallfrown{y_2})
  \end{equation}
  for arbitrary ${{x}:n\mapsto \mathbb{N}},\,{{y_1}:k_1\mapsto \mathbb{N}},\,
  {{y_2}:k_2\mapsto \mathbb{N}}$.
  The existence of such polynomials have been showed in  Th.~\ref{Th27},~\ref{Th28}.
  The construction of these polynomials is useful for the further  development of multivariate polynomials in
  the Mizar Mathematical Library. Therefore we define and provide basic  properties of two transformations
  that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item add an additional variable to the polynomial, preserving its value, i.e.
  \begin{equation}
    \forall_{{x}:n\mapsto \mathbb{N},a \in \mathbb{N}}\,
    \mbox{eval}(p \mbox{ extended by }0,x^\smallfrown\langle a\rangle)  =  \mbox{eval}(p,x),\\
  \end{equation}
  \item permute the order of variables, preserving its value, i.e.
  \begin{equation}
   \forall_{{x}:n\mapsto \mathbb{N}}\,
  \mbox{eval}(p \mbox{ permuted by }\sigma,x) =   \mbox{eval}(p,x\cdot\sigma^{-1}).
  \end{equation}
  \end{itemize}}
