  SUMMARY = {In this paper we account for the formalization of the seven bridges of K\"{o}nigsberg puzzle.
  The problem originally posed and solved by Euler in 1735 is historically notable
  for having laid the foundations of graph theory, cf. \cite{Chartrand:1985}.
  Our formalization utilizes a simple set-theoretical graph representation with
  four distinct sets for the graph's vertices and another seven sets that represent
  the edges (bridges). The work appends the article by Nakamura and Rudnicki \cite{GRAPH_3.MIZ}
  by introducing the classic example of a graph that does not contain an Eulerian path.}}
