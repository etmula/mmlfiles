  SUMMARY = {In this article, we deal with the Riemann integral
  of functions from $\mathbbbR$ into a real Banach space.
  The last theorem establishes the integrability of continuous
  functions on the closed interval of reals.
  To prove the integrability, we defined uniform
  continuity for functions from
  $\mathbbbR$ into a real normed space and proved related theorems.
  We also stated some properties of finite
  sequences of elements of a real normed space and
  finite sequences of real numbers.\par
  In addition, we proved some theorems about the convergence of sequences.
  We applied definitions introduced in
  the previous article \cite{INTEGR18.ABS} to
  the proof of integrability.}}
