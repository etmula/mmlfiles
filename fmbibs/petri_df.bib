  SUMMARY = {In this article we formalize the definition of decision-free Petri
  net (DFPN) presented in \cite{Wang:1998}. Then we formalize the concept of
  directed path and directed circuit nets in Petri Nets to prove properties of
  DFPN. We also present the definition of firing transitions and transition
  sequences with NAT marking that always check whether transition is enabled or
  not and after firing it only removes the available tokens (i.e., it does not
  remove from zero number of tokens). At the end of this article, we show that
  the total number of tokens in a circuit of decision free Petri net always
  remains same after firing any sequences of the transition.}}
